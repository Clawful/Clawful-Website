  We use a database to store some information about the guilds and users Clawful
  manages. But what do we do with this information? For your own peace of mind,
  long story short: Nothing at all.

# Privacy Policy

 _**Users Stored Information**_

In our database we store your ID and the amount of hairs you have. This is necessary in case you change your Username and not dangerous for your account as it is _public information_.

 _**Servers Stored Information**_

We store your server ID, Name and Autoroles set, this is used for the moderation and roles commands.

 _**Moderation Information Stored**_

 I'll explain it this way: if you are in two servers both using Clawful and you get banned in one, you don't wanna get banned in the other one, do you? For that reason we need to save each warn/kick/ban in each user for each server, but again, all this is _public information_.

### You don't want Clawful to store your information?

_**Deleting Data**_

 To delete your guild Warns/Kicks/Bans/Autoroles you can use the command`cw!wipedb <DB to delete>`. To delete your guild or yourself as a user contact support in the Clawful Development Server and we'll do it for you.
